### Hi there! I'm Zoya Hammad 👋

I am a high-school student trying to break into tech one step at a time. I am eager to learn new tools and techologies but I prefer to 'learn by doing'. 

I have decent knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript and some React. I have also done some courses on Python & Data Anlaysis from University of Michigan and UPenn.
